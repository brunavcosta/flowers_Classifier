## 🌸 Flower Classification with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates how to classify flowers using a neural network built with TensorFlow. It is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and walks through the steps of loading the dataset, building a model, training it, and evaluating its accuracy.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains flower measurements and labels for three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each flower is described by:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

This is essentially a multiclass classification task based on numeric input features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The neural network is implemented using tf.keras.Sequential, and typically includes:

- Input layer matching the number of features
- One or more hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with softmax (for multi-class classification)

## 📊 Workflow
- Import dependencies
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Build the neural network
- Compile the model
- Train the model
- Evaluate accuracy on test data

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Open Classifier_Flowers.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.x installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas
```
Run the notebook cells step by step.

## 📈 Example Use Case
Ideal for beginners learning TensorFlow and neural networks, this notebook offers a clean and interpretable dataset (likely the Iris dataset) to get hands-on experience with deep learning for classification.
